# Threads For Life

This repository contains solutions to the following well known synchronization problems in C++ -
1. Printing alternate even and odd numbers using 2 threads.
2. Consumer Producer Problem.
3. Dining Philosopher Problem.
4. Readers-Writers Problem.

The code uses semaphore's - they were introduced in c++20, so for compilation, add "-std=c++20" argument/flag to the g++/clang++ compiler.

## TODO

Add code to learn about fork() in C.
